# Modeling Plot Filesize

The purpose of this analysis is to create a linear model to predict the filesize of a plot,
based on the dpi used in creating the plot.

Methodology
First we generate 2 random set of numbers referred to as X and Y. 

Than we generates plots of X and Y, varying the dpi.

We than examine the relationship between dpi our explanatory variable and fileseize or response variable.

If the relationship is linear, we will construct a linear model.
